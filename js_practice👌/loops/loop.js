//loops
//Repeatedly run a block of code while condition is true
// while loop
let amout = 16;
while (amout > 0)
{
    console.log("I have " + amout + " Dollars i use ");
    amout--;// amount = amount -1 it will decrease every time

}
// do not write true in while loop it will print infinite times
// so we can use conditions
