        <h2>MISSILE MAN OF INDIA</h2>
        <P><B>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</B> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015)
             was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president
              of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, 
              Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
               the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly
                at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
                 Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's 
                 civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus 
                 came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                  ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal 
                  organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
                   1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</P>
