            MADARA UCHIHA
        </h2>
        <p>
            Madara Uchiha (Japanese: うちは マダラ, Hepburn: Uchiha Madara) is a main antagonist manga and anime 
            character in the Naruto series created by Masashi Kishimoto. He appears for the first time in "Part II" of 
            the manga and the Shippuden anime adaptation, as a major antagonist. He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju, 
            is one of the co-founders of Konohagakure (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れの里, Hepburn: Konohagakure no Sato) village from the ninja world. 
            Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, 
            it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named Obito Uchiha as his agent. He transplants his Rinnegan (輪廻眼, lit. "Saṃsāra Eye")
             eye power into a child named Nagato, a member of the terrorist organization Akatsuki, to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. 
             During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named Kabuto Yakushi reanimates the real Madara who becomes one of the primary 
             antagonists alongside Obito Uchiha during the Fourth Great Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including
              a Boruto feature film. Many Naruto video games have featured him as a playable character.

           DEATH NOTE
        </h2>
        <p>
            Death Note (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. It was serialized in
             Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006, with its chapters collected in 12 tankōbon volumes. The story 
             follows Light Yagami, a genius high school student who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the shinigami Ryuk, and 
             grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to 
             use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a god-like 
             vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him.
             A 37-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Madhouse and directed by Tetsurō Araki, was broadcast on Nippon Television from
              October 2006 to June 2007. A light novel based on the series, written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 2006. Additionally, various video
               games have been published by Konami for the Nintendo DS. The series was adapted into three live-action films released in Japan in June, November 
               2006, and February 2008, and a television drama in 2015. A miniseries titled Death Note: New Generation and a fourth film were released in 2016. 
               An American film adaptation was released exclusively on Netflix in August 2017, and a series is reportedly in the works.
